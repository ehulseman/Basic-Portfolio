            <p class="aboutmetext">My name is Elizah Hulseman. I am 26 years old. I live in Portsmouth, NH and have since I was nine years old.
                When I was sixteen, I lived in Florence, Italy for a year and as a result speak fluent Italian. I love foreign
                languages, travel and learning about history, art, and architecture.</p>

            <p class="aboutmetext">After graduating from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, I moved back to Portmsouth and got a job in the
                software world despite having graduated with a degree in Human Geography with Environmental Studies. I have
                been working as a product manager for the past three and half years, working solely within the construction
                space. I currently live with my partner, Abner, in our duplex in Portsmouth with our two cats Agathon and
                Leone.
